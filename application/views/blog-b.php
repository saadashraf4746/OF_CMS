			<h3>Myth #2: It’s Risky</h3>
			<p>
				There’s a common misconception that buying a secondary property is more 
				affordable and easier to secure a mortgage when in actual fact, buying 
				off-plan can be cheaper, especially if you get in there early. Under-construction 
				properties are typically priced lower than ready properties, as essentially you 
				are buying into its potential rather than physical attributes, and carry a higher 
				probability of capital appreciation near to completion. Whereas the closer to handover 
				you get, the bigger the chance of the price increases, especially if the buzz is sustained 
				around the project and its surrounding areas. You’ve heard the phrase: ‘The early bird 
				catches the worm’ and that’s undoubtedly the case when it comes to off-plan.
			</p>
			<p>Another advantage to consider is the flexible payment plans now available, with most 
				accepting a small down payment of between 5-10%, and even working out a favorable 
				post-handover plan that lets you rent out or live in the property first before paying 
				it all off. In some cases developers are also waiving the 4% registration fee and service 
				charges, even extending to 10 years, to further stimulate the off-plan market, and to reduce 
				the financial burden on those wanting to invest.
